PHP User Framework
==================

Includes a basic user sign up and login template.

**Demo login:** test@test.com / test1234

**Database template:** template.sql (change the connection settings in models/settings.php)

TODO
----

  * Change forgot password so it asks the user to provide a new password
  * Complete/test email activation (will need to switch out mailing functions)
  * Switch language strings to .pot file
